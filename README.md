# Hospital Management System 
A comprehensive, web-based Hospital Management System (HMS) designed to automate and streamline the core operations of healthcare facilities. This project replaces manual, paper-based methods with efficient digital workflows, improving data accuracy, patient care, and overall operational efficiency.

üåü Abstract
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a web-based solution that manages patient registrations, medical records, appointments, and staff schedules through a secure, role-based access model. Its implementation enables hospitals to maintain accurate and up-to-date patient and administrative data, improve resource utilization, and minimize operational errors. The system features distinct modules for administrators, doctors, and patients, supporting real-time information sharing and seamless coordination between departments.

üéØ Project Objective
The primary objectives of this project are to:

Automate Operations: Computerize patient and hospital data to improve data retrieval, storage, and analysis.

Enhance Patient Care: Streamline appointment scheduling and provide patients with easy access to their medical information.

Improve Management: Provide secure role-based access for doctors, staff, and administrators to improve departmental coordination and resource utilization.

Data-Driven Decisions: Ensure better decision-making supported by comprehensive reporting and analytics.

‚ú® Key Features
This system is divided into two main portals: one for Doctors and one for Patients.

üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Doctor Portal
Secure Login: Doctors can log in with their credentials.

Dashboard: View and manage patient appointments for specific dates.

Appointment Management: Approve, pending, or cancel patient appointments in real-time.

Patient Search: Quickly search for patients by name.

Staff Management: View a directory of all hospital staff members.

Add Staff: A form to add new staff members to the hospital's system.

Profile Management: Doctors can view and edit their professional profiles.


‚ù§Ô∏è Patient Portal
Secure Login/Registration: Patients can create an account and log in.

Dashboard: Search for doctors by name, hospital, or specialization.

Book Appointments: A user-friendly form to book appointments with a chosen doctor.

View Doctors: See a list of available doctors and their details.

Appointment History: View past and upcoming appointments.

Profile Management: Patients can manage their personal and medical information.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Java Servlets, JSP (JavaServer Pages)

Database: MySQL

Web Server: Apache Tomcat

‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture
The system employs a multi-tier architecture:

Presentation Layer: The user interface built with HTML, CSS, and JSP pages that users interact with.

Business Logic Layer: Consists of Java Servlets that process user requests and implement the core application logic.

Data Layer: A MySQL database that stores all persistent data, including patient records, appointments, and staff information.

üöÄ Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
JDK (Java Development Kit): Ensure you have JDK 8 or higher installed.

MySQL: Install a MySQL server. You can use XAMPP, WAMP, or install it directly.

Apache Tomcat: Install Tomcat 9 or a compatible version.

IDE: An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java support.

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone ([https://github.com/rohannaik06/hospital-management-system.git](https://github.com/Rohannaik06/Hospital-Management-System))

Database Setup:

Open your MySQL client (like phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench).

Create a new database named HMS.

Import the database.sql file (if provided) or manually create the necessary tables (doctors, patients, appointments, staff).

Configure the Project:

Open the project in your favorite IDE.

Locate the database connection strings in the .jsp files (e.g., in doctorlogin.jsp, appointment.jsp, etc.).

Update the database URL, username, and password to match your MySQL setup.

// Example connection string in JSP files
conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/HMS", "root", "your_password");

Deploy to Tomcat:

Configure your IDE to use your installed Apache Tomcat server.

Build the project to generate a .war file.

Deploy the .war file to your Tomcat server.

Access the Application:

Start your Tomcat server.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/your_project_name/.
